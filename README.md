# RAD302
What is working
You can select a country it then brings up details of the country, capital population
it then using the google map api puts a pointer on the countries capital and a layer has been added to the maps plugin so you can see the weather in the area


What I couldnt get working
I wanted to have it so that the person has to authenticate themselves with facebook login. and then they can see the destinations that they have travelled to.
I was unable to get the authentification working. You can select facebook auth but when you get redircted to facebook to login facebook gives an error is it doesnt recognise the url, even though i have the localhost url in my app on the facebook developer console.
